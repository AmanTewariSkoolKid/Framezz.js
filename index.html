  HTML DOCUMENT DECLARATION AND SETUP
  
  Think of this HTML file like a blueprint for a house. Just like a blueprint tells builders
  what rooms go where and how they connect, this HTML tells the web browser what content
  to display and how to arrange it on the page.
  
  This is a video annotation tool - imagine having a video and being able to draw boxes
  around objects (like people, cars, etc.) and have the computer remember where those
  boxes are in each frame. That's what this tool does!
-->

<!doctype html> <!-- This line tells the browser "Hey, this is modern HTML!" -->

<html lang="en"> <!-- This starts our HTML document and says it's written in English -->
  <head>
    <!-- 
      The HEAD section is like the "behind the scenes" information about our webpage.
      Users don't see this content directly, but it tells the browser important setup info.
      Think of it like the ingredients list on a recipe - you need to know what's required
      before you start cooking!
    -->

  <body>
    <!-- 
      THE BODY SECTION - This is where all the visible content lives!
      Everything between <body> and </body> is what users actually see on the webpage.
      Think of this like the main floor plan of a house - this is where people actually live and interact.

      ORDERED LIST - THE STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW
      
      An <ol> (ordered list) is like a recipe or instruction manual. Each <li> (list item) 
      is a step that users need to follow in order. The browser automatically numbers them 1, 2, 3, etc.
      
      This particular list guides users through the entire process of annotating a video,
      from start to finish. It's designed to be foolproof - just follow the steps!

    <ol>
      <li>
        <!-- 
          STEP 1: INTRODUCTION TO THE TOOL
          This first step is like the "welcome mat" of the application. It explains what
          the tool does and sets expectations for the user. Think of it like reading
          the back of a box before opening a new game - you want to know what you're getting into!
        -->
        <p>framez.js is a pure Javascript video annotation tool, which allows you to annotate videos in your browser.</p>
        <p>This tool can be used to easily annotate a video, without having to install anything.</p>
        <p>Optical flow is used to track your annotations, so that have to do as little work as possible ;-)</p>
        <p>This tool works best in Chrome, and has also been successfully tested in Firefox.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <!-- 
          STEP 2: FILE INPUT SECTION
          This is where users choose their files. Think of it like choosing ingredients for cooking:
          - You can either start fresh with a new video (like buying fresh ingredients)
          - Or you can continue with work you already started (like using leftovers from yesterday)
          
          The "input type='file'" creates those "Choose File" buttons you see on websites.
          The "accept" attribute tells the browser what types of files are allowed - it's like
          having a bouncer at a club who only lets in certain types of people!
        -->
        <p>To start a new video annotation, select a video file: <input type="file" id="videoFile" accept="video/*" /></p> 
        <!-- The "accept='video/*'" means "accept any type of video file" (MP4, AVI, etc.) -->
        
        <p>To resume a previous annotation, select a frames zip archive: <input type="file" id="zipFile" accept=".zip" /></p>
        <!-- The "accept='.zip'" means only ZIP files are allowed here -->
        
        <p>Note: Keep the focus on the browser during the entire extraction process, or frames might be skipped.</p>
        <!-- This is like saying "don't walk away from the stove while cooking" - stay focused! -->
        
        <!-- 
          These next two paragraphs are "output areas" - they start empty but will be filled
          with information by JavaScript code later. Think of them like empty picture frames
          that will have photos put in them later.
        -->
        <p class="output" id="videoDimensions"></p> <!-- Will show video size like "1920x1080" -->
        <p class="output" id="extractionProgress"></p> <!-- Will show progress like "50% complete" -->
      </li>
      <li>
        <!-- 
          STEP 3: DOWNLOAD EXTRACTED FRAMES
          After the tool breaks down the video into individual frames (like taking apart
          a flip-book into separate pages), this button lets you download all those frames
          as a ZIP file. Think of it like getting a folder full of photos from your video.
          
          The "disabled='disabled'" means this button starts "grayed out" and unusable - 
          it only becomes clickable after the previous steps are completed.
        -->
        <p>Download the extracted frames zip archive: <input type="button" id="downloadFrames" value="Get frames zip archive" disabled="disabled" /></p>
        <!-- This button will become enabled by JavaScript once frame extraction is complete -->
      </li>
      <li>
        <!-- 
          STEP 4: OPTIONAL ANNOTATION FILE LOADING
          This is like importing a rough draft of your homework that you want to finish.
          Sometimes you might already have some automatic annotations (maybe from AI software)
          or previous work that you want to continue improving.
          
          XML is a file format (like .txt or .doc) that stores structured data.
          Think of it like a very organized filing cabinet where information is stored
          in a specific, predictable way.
        -->
        <p>Optional: Load an existing -compatible XML annotation file: <input type="file" id="xmlFile" accept=".xml" disabled="true" /></p>
        <!-- This input is also disabled initially and will be enabled by JavaScript later -->
        
        <p>This is useful for example if:</p>
        <ul>
          <!-- 
            UNORDERED LIST - This creates bullet points (unlike the numbered list above)
            Think of this like a shopping list where order doesn't matter
          -->
          <li>You are resuming a previous annotation.</li> <!-- Continuing work you started before -->
          <li>You already have a first version of your automatic object detector, which you want to improve by manually correcting its errors.</li>
          <!-- Like having a robot assistant that did 80% of the work, but you need to fix its mistakes -->
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Launch your object detector on the extracted frames rather than on the original video to avoid frame/annotation mismatches!</p>
        <!-- This is important technical advice - like making sure you're working with the same ingredients your recipe calls for -->
      </li>
      <li>
        <!-- 
          STEP 5: THE MAIN ANNOTATION INTERFACE
          This is the heart of the application - where the actual work happens!
          Think of this like the main workspace where you'll spend most of your time,
          similar to how a photo editing program has a main canvas where you do your work.
        -->
        <p>Manually annotate the frame sequence:</p>

          INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING BOUNDING BOXES
          A "bounding box" is like drawing a rectangle around an object in the video.
          Imagine outlining a person or car with a highlighter - that's what this does digitally.
        -->
        <p>To create a new bounding box, first click 'n' (for new), and then left click on two locations in the video corresponding to the corners of the box.</p>

          KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS AND TIPS
          These are like hotkeys in video games - shortcuts that make you work faster.
          Professional video editors use these kinds of shortcuts all the time.
        -->
        <p>Tip: Use the spacebar to play/pause the video, and the left and right arrows to navigate frame by frame.</p>
        <p>Tip: The visibility of each object can be toggled with its visibility checkbox under the video.</p>
        <p>Tip: Zoom in with your browser to place the bounding boxes more accurately.</p>
        
        <!-- 
          THE VIDEO CANVAS CONTAINER
          This div (division/container) will hold the actual video and drawing area.
          Think of it like a picture frame - it defines the space where the video will appear.
          The id="doodle" gives it a unique name so JavaScript can find and control it.
